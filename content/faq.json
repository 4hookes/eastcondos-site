      "question": "We're not ready yet. Should I get the checker?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. The best time to plan is 6–12 months before you're ready. The tool helps you prepare so you're in position when the time comes."

      "question": "Why only East Singapore?",
      "answer": "I'd rather be excellent in one area than average everywhere. My network, knowledge, and off-market access are concentrated here—better results for you."

    {
      "question": "Do I need to sell my HDB first?",
      "answer": "Not necessarily. Many clients buy first, then sell. I'll help structure the timeline so you're never homeless or overextended."

    {
      "question": "What if you say it's not the right time?",
      "answer": "Then I'll explain why, and we'll plan for when it makes sense. I'd rather earn your trust than push you into something wrong."
